              <p>In fact, <i>close menu</i> we put the menu icon on the right because statistics show most people hold their phones in their right hand, and this makes it easier for people to reach with their thumbs.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
          		<p>Let's take a look at an example of how a grid can reflow. <i>launch demo</i></p>
              <p>Now, for this demo I'm just using the basic outline of a grid. These boxes could contain any kind of content &mdash; text, images, buttons, and so on.</p>
              <p>These are two examples that take different approaches to responsiveness.</p>
              <p>At the top are three sections laid side-by-side and split into equal thirds.</p>
              <p>Down here, in red, we have a similar side-by-side layout. But lets assume that the content in these red areas can't get much narrower and still be usable.</p>
              <p>Let's see how these two arrangements react when we go down to the size of a tablet.</p>
              <p><i>click tablet</i></p>
              <p>Your eye was probably drawn to the red area where the pieces are now stacked vertically. This ensures each one has enough width for its content.</p>
              <p>But up here, the blue layout is no longer split into thirds. <i>mouse around right side</i> Because the content in this piece needs more width, it has actually expanded to take up half of the screen. Over on the left the pieces have been shrunk down to compensate.</p>
              <p>Let's take grids a step further.</p>
              <p><i>click 'Advanced' button</i></p>
              <p>Now we have two separate structures nested together. At this size, most of the pieces are stacked on top of each other and they're pretty symmetrical.</p>
              <p>Let's go back to a wider screen. <i>click desktop</i></p>
              <p>Now everything is side-by-side, all in one row. The pieces are using different proportions then before &mdash; they're no longer symmetrical. This is all the same HTML and the same content, it's just laid out differently to maintain legibility.</p>
              <p>The code behind this is not complex. It's the approach to your page's structure that requires some thought. You really have to take a moment to look at your content on different-sized screens to get a feel for what works best.</p>

              <p>Let's think about how we can make all that data available everywhere. <i>open demo</i></p>
              <p>Here we have some scientists and information about them. It's all important information, but for any given user some of it will be more important than the rest.</p>
              <p>So let's try and show as much data as possible, as long as it still fits. The summary column would be a good place to start since it takes so much room to display legibly.<i>click tablet</i></p>
              <p>So now the summary column is gone, which gives the rest of the data more room to breathe.</p>
              <p>And if the user wants to, they can still see the summary with this handy menu right above the table. <i>use menu to show summary</i></p>
              <p>This menu lets the user tell us what's important to them. <i>hide summary</i></p>
              <p>Let's go a bit further, all the way down to a smart phone size. <i>click phone</i></p>
              <p>Now we're left with 3 columns, because the data would be too squished if we showed more.</p>
              <p>These 3 columns were deemed more important by the page designer, who specified each column's importance in the page's HTML.</p>
              <p>Again, ultimately it's up to the user to decide what's useful, and if they want to they can always re-display columns and scroll around to view the content. <i>redisplay all columns and scroll around</i></p>

          After everything we've shown today, You still need to figure out how to pull off RWD correctly.<br>
          <i>&raquo; </i>Normally you'd start by querying your favorite search engine for "RWD" and sift through 20 million results<br>
          Each link of varying quality and opinions<br>
          Some of which are just dead wrong, OR <i>Next &raquo; </i>

					So you tried out Excelsior and you decided that for whatever reason, it's just not the right solution for your current project.<br>
					That's okay we know it's not for everyone, and you did your due diligence<br>
					But even though Excelsior didn't fit, you still need to implement that Responsive Design somehow, right?<br>
					I urge you to take those first steps into Responsive Design, <i>&raquo; </i> Today<br>
					Start by taking advantage of the resources we put together on the Go Responsive site<br>
					Join the Responsive Web Design Group on Yammer and say hi or ask for help<br>
					Take a look at some of the really amazing responsive design projects all across GitHub that are being updated every day<br>
					and yes you should even wade through 20 million Google search results to learn even more<br>
					And, before you know it, you will have made the Responsive web site of your dreams!<i>Next &raquo; </i>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          Start - "Great Question"<br>
Can't use GitHub at work -- can still download from the webpage until official permission is granted<br>
What about apps -- Native apps have their place on the web, and with the right configuration you could use Excelsior for them as well<br>
IE support - We're officially supporting what Foundation does, but we don't limit you from making any changes to the framework to fit your needs<br>

Great Question, I don't have an answer offhand - I'd be glad to look into it for you. Drop me an email or create an issue on Github.<br>
